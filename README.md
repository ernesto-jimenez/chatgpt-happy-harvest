# ChatGPT's Happy Harvest

This is a quick experiment to create a simple HTML game entirely using ChatGPT.

All the code was written by ChatGPT, and I aimed to provide as little direction as possible when there are bugs.

You can play the game in https://ernesto-jimenez.github.io/chatgpt-happy-harvest/ or check the [conversation with ChatGPT to build this game](conversation.md).
